class project creating an app for movie watchers

“StreamOn”: This project application is a search engine that will display available streaming applications for a specific movie.

As a movie watcher, I want to know which streaming applications are available to watch the movie on. This will reduce time spent searching for streaming applications to watch my movie.

Firstly, a brief description of your motivation for the application and what functionality can a user expect to find when running the app. Basically, your application's elevator pitch (something similar to the first talking points of your project presentation).

Secondly, a working link which will take your user to the deployed location of your app. Near this link also include your version number and a date.
Third, I recommend you set up a trial account (one which will allow a visitor to access the logged in elements of your application without providing their own details). Something like user:admin password:admin just so that anyone who finds your site through your repository can easily access all the features you've built.
Fourth, in that same vein, you'll want to provide a walkt-hrough of how the user can get your application up and running locally. This will be good for recruiters in case they wanted to see your code run on their own machines for whatever reason, but also good for anyone intending to fork your application and provide your app with pull requests. Remember that any public repo on GitHub is considered open-source and consider that allowing others to collaborate with you is actually a wonderful thing! Consider here if you're making use of any environment variables, if they'll need a local database running, things of that nature.
Lastly, you might include any future dev ideas. This will tie in to the fact that other developers might find your app and be motivated to work on it. You'll want to provide them with ideas for features which you as the creator deem relevant to your app's scope.
